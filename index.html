        <p class="lead mb-4">
          I'm a university student about to graduate this year. After many years of being undeclared,
          I decided on art history as my major because of my love for the arts. I don‚Äôt have much work experience,
          in fact now that I think about it I have absolutely no work experience at all. I‚Äôm excited to look for new opportunities
          to progress in my career path and further discover where I want to go with my life. <br><br>

          I‚Äôm 23 years old from Brea, California. My super awesome hobbies include basketball, drawing, playing video games, etc.
          I usually play basketball by myself when I need a little exercise. I would play a competitive game with strangers, but I‚Äôm not that good yet.
          Video games have been a staple to my childhood and my adult years. I grew up playing so many different kinds of games and to see the gaming industry
          gradually change throughout the years has been interesting to say the least. I‚Äôm a big music fan; I can‚Äôt go a single day without listening to some of my favorite songs.
          I could probably listen to every genre except country. Traveling has also been super fun throughout the years. My favorite places to travel to so far have been Japan, Hawaii, and Taiwan.
          Hopefully in the future I could travel to countries in Europe as well.
          <br><br>

          I first went into UC Riverside with a very slight interest in environmental science. Seeing that I wasn‚Äôt completely sure with this decision I went undeclared and explored my options.
          I would jump between the sciences, creative writing, and psychology. There was also a moment where I considered computer science, considering I actually did four years of computer science in high school.
          I was able to learn C sharp, flash, html, and java. I decided against it because I really struggled in those four years (I only got into computer science because my parents promised me a laptop and smartphone,
          but I learned to love the friends I made and things I learned in the class). After basically being forced to make a decision I declared as an art history major.
          The one art history class I took as a general education requirement really interested me and I decided to pursue the major further. I have no specific area I‚Äôm studying in art history.
          I have studied many different countries and time periods, with early American art and Asian art being my favorites to learn about. Although I don‚Äôt have much administrative knowledge yet, working in a museum interests me a lot.
          The one major thing that I could describe as ‚Äúwork‚Äù is being a teaching assistant for my grandpa. My grandpa is a tai chi teacher, spending the weekends helping experienced students practice for competition and teaching new students as well.
          I have been practicing martial arts since I was five years old. I first started with Shaolin and when my grandpa noticed my abilities in that area, he instead decided to teach me tai chi himself.
          Now, after having learned so much from him he asks me to help him teach students that are just starting out and unfamiliar with tai chi. In a way, I‚Äôm also a translator for those that speak English because my grandpa mainly speaks Mandarin when he teaches.
